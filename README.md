# 🧑‍💻 Jobless Portal 

Welcome to **Jobless Portal**, Built with ❤️ using **React + Vite** 

## 🚀 What is This?

It's a job portal. You know, for posting jobs, looking at jobs, and maybe applying for them if you're into that kind of responsible adult stuff.

This is a **study project**, so if you see a bug, it's probably on purpose. Or not. Who knows. 🤷

## 🤖 Project Structure (a.k.a. where stuff lives)

```txt
/src
  /components  --> Your reusable job thingies
  /pages       --> Main pages like Home, Jobs, etc.
  /assets      --> Images, icons,
  App.jsx      --> App starts here, duh
```

## 🤝 Contribution

This is for **my team** (yes, you 👀), so:

* 🧼 Don’t break stuff… or do — but fix it right after like a responsible coder.
* 🧾 **Write clear commit messages.**
  No more `..` or `update` or `fix again again final fixed v2 real`. Be specific, like:

  * `add job listing card component`
  * `fix broken navbar link`
  * `style login page like a boss`

---

## 📝 Notes to My Team

* If it breaks, you probably forgot to run `npm install`.
* If it still breaks, congrats, you're now the official bug fixer. 🐛
* Clone this or you’re fired. (JK... unless? 👀)
